Hi <%= @alert.contact_name %>

<% rollup_alerts_count = @alert.rollup_alerts.length %>

You have <%= rollup_alerts_count %> alerting check<%= rollup_alerts_count == 1 ? '' : 's' %> as follows:

<%  @alert.rollup_alerts.all.sort_by(&:duration).each do |rollup_alert|
      check    = rollup_alert.check
      state    = rollup_alert.state
      duration = (ChronicDuration.output(rollup_alert.duration, :keep_zero => true) || '0 secs') -%>
  * <%= check.name %> is <%= ['ok'].include?(state) ? state.upcase : state.titleize %> (<%= duration %>)
<% end -%>

<% rollup_threshold = @alert.medium.rollup_threshold -%>
<% if 'recovery'.eql?(@alert.rollup) -%>
As your email summary threshold is <%= rollup_threshold %>, we're taking your email alerts out of summary mode now. You'll now be emailed individually for each alerting check.
<% else -%>
Your email alerts are being summarised as your email summary threshold is set to <%= rollup_threshold %>. You'll receive summary emails like this one until your number of alerting checks falls below <%= rollup_threshold %>.
<% end -%>

Cheers,
Flapjack
